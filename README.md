# rdtsc - Binding for the rdtsc machine instruction

This small Cabal package provides a Haskell binding to the "rdtsc"
machine instruction on modern IA-32 processors.  This instruction can
be used to read the number of cycles since processor startup and gives
very accurate timing information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: this package contains the file cycle.h by Matteo Frigo, which
provides access to cycle counters on several architectures.  The

## Usage

Use

    cabal install rdtsc

for building and installing system-wide, or

    tar xzvf rdtsc-X.Y.Z.W.tar.gz
    cd rdtsc-X.Y.Z.W
    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install

for building and installing in a sandbox.

Just import module "System.CPUTime.Rdtsc" into your Haskell file and use

  ghc --make FILENAME

to compile your program.

The "tests" directory contains a small test program for the module and
demonstrates its usage.  There is also a C version for this test
program, to test the overheads of Haskell's FFI.

Happy Haskell hacking,
